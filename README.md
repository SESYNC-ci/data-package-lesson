# Data package lesson
   
Package your data and metadata for publication
  
# Instructor Notes
  
 - ask learners if they have experience publishing their data or trying to use someone else's data
 - include definitions of different terms (packages, file types, file formats, etc.)
 - ask learners if they've every tried to contact a paper author for data when the paper said "data available on request"
 - mention difference between generalist and domain-specific repositories regarding metadata requirements, controlled vocabs, searching, etc.
 - show GUI/website for a repository, and maybe a brief demo of creating metadata
