## Publishing your data 

Now that you've packaged up your data, it's easier to publish! 

Choosing to publish your data in a long-term repository can:

   - enable versioning of your data
   - fulfill a journal requirement to publish data
   - facilitate citing your dataset by assigning a permanent uniquely identifiable code (DOI)
   - improve discovery of and access to your dataset for others
   - enable re-use and greater visibility of your work

===

### Why can't I just put my data on Dropbox, Google Drive, my website, etc?

===

#### Key reasons to use a repository:

  - preservation (permanence)
  - stability (replication / backup)
  - access 
  - standards
  
===

### When to publish your data?

Near the beginning?  At the very end?  

===

A couple issues to think about: 

1) How do you know you're using the same version of a file as your collaborator?

   - Publish your data privately and use the unique ids of datasets to manage versions.

===

2) How do you control access to your data until you're ready to go public with it?

   - Embargoing - controlling access for a certain period of time and then making your data public.

===

### Get an ORCiD 
 
ORCiDs identify you and link you to your publications and research products.  They are used by journals, repositories, etc. and often as a log in.

===

If you don't have one yet, get an ORCiD.  Register at [https://orcid.org](https://orcid.org).

### Picking a repository 

There are many repositories out there, and it can seem overwhelming picking a suitable one for your data. 

Repositories can be subject or domain specific.  [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) lists repositories by subject and can help you pick an appropriate repository for your data.  

===

[DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) is a federation of repositories housing many different types of data.  Some of these repositories include Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity [(KNB)](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/), Environmental Data Initiative [(EDI)](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/), [USGS Science Data Catalog](https://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/)

For qualitative data, there are a few dedicated repositories: [QDR](https://qdr.syr.edu/), [Data-PASS](http://data-pass.org/)

===

Though a bit different, [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) facilitates publishing (with a DOI) and archiving all research outputs from all research fields.  

One example is using Zenodo to publish releases of your code that lives in a GitHub repository.  However, since GitHub is not designed for data storage and is not a persistent repository, this is not a recommended way to store or publish data.

### Uploading to a repository

Uploading requirements can vary by repository and type of data.  The minimum you usually need is basic metadata, and a data file.  

If you have a small number of files, using a repository GUI may be simpler.  For large numbers of files, automating uploads from R will save time.  And it's reproducible, which is always good!  

===

#### Data Upload Example - DataONE:

If you choose to upload your data package to a repository in the [DataONE federation](https://www.dataone.org/) of repositories, the following example may be helpful.  The basic steps we will walk through in detail below are     

1) Getting an authentication token (follow steps below)

2) Getting a DOI (if desired) from your chosen repository 

3) Uploading your data package using R

===

| R Package   | What does it do?                      |
|-------------+---------------------------------------|
| `dataone`   | uploads data package to repository    |

```{r, handout = 0}
library(dataone)
library(curl) 
library(redland) 
```

===

**Tokens:**

Different environments in DataONE take different authentication tokens.  Essentially, the *staging environment is for testing*, and the *production environment is for publishing*.  If you are running the code in this lesson with the example data included here, get a token for the *staging environment*.  If you are modifying this code to publish your own research data, get a token for the *production environment*.  
===

To get a token for the staging environment start here [Staging Environment](https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu).

To get a token for the production environment start here [Production Environment](https://search.dataone.org).  

If you happen to notice that the staging environment link above is an address at `nceas.ucsb.edu`, don't worry.  [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) is a project administered by [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), which is a research affiliate of [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/).

After following either link above, complete the following steps to get your token. 

  - Click *Sign in*, or *Sign up* if necessary
  - Once signed in, move the cursor over the user name and select *My profile* in the drop down menu.
  - Click on the *Settings* tab.
  - Click on *Authentication Token* in the menu below *Welcome*
  - Click on the *Token for DataONE R* tab.
  - Click *Renew authentication token* if the token you have been using has expired.
  - Click on the *Copy* button below the text window to copy the authentication string to the paste buffer.
  - Paste the token string in the R console.

*You may want to note the expiration date of the token, which will be displayed on this page.*

===

#### Set your token now

Paste your token for DataONE R in the R console, as stated in the instructions above.

### Citation

Getting a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for your data package can make it easier for others to find and cite your data.  

===

DOIs are associated with a particular repository or publisher, so you will need to specify the environment and repository (also called a member node) in which you are publishing your data. 

The environment is where you publish your data: "PROD" is production, and "STAGING" is to test uploading your data, and can be used if you're not yet sure you have everything in order.  
{:.notes}

NOTE: "PROD" and "STAGING" require different tokens.  
See above steps to get the appropriate access token.
{:.notes}

===

If you don't know your repository specs, look it up in this table of member node IDs: (data/Nodes.csv) 

```{r, handout = 0, eval = FALSE}
read.csv("data/Nodes.csv")
```

===

You can get a DOI from your target repository if you desire.  We won't actually do this in the lesson here, because we're not going to publish our example data.  However, this code is provided for your future use when you are ready to publish your own data with a DOI.      

```{r, handout = 0, eval = FALSE}
# cn <- CNode("PROD")
# mn <- getMNode(cn, "urn:node:KNB")  

# doi <- generateIdentifier(mn, "DOI")
```

===

Then you would overwrite the previous metadata file with the new DOI identified metadata file.  Again, we won't do this here, as we're not going to publish our example data.  But the code provided here can be modified when you are ready to publish your own data.  

```{r, handout = 0, eval = FALSE}
# emlFile <- "~/storm_project/eml/storm_events_package_id.xml"

# mdObj <- new("DataObject", id = doi, format = "eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.1", file = emlFile)

# dp <- addMember(dp, mdObj)
```

Then you would zip up all your files for your data package with BagIt as shown in the previous section.    

===

#### Set access rules 

NOTE: Replace this example ORCID with your own ORCID!

```{r, handout = 0}
dpAccessRules <- data.frame(subject = "http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0847-9100", 
                            permission = "changePermission") 
```

This gives this particular ORCID (person) permission to read, write, and change permissions for others for this package.

===

```{r, handout = 0}
dpAccessRules2 <- data.frame(subject = c("http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0847-9100",
                                         "http://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001"),
                             permission = c("changePermission", "read")
                             )
```

The second person (ORCID) only has access to read the files in this package.  

NOTE: When you upload the package, you can set `public = FALSE` if you don't want your package public yet.  

===

#### Upload data package

First set the environment and repository you'll upload to.  

NOTE: We are using the "STAGING2" environment and "TestKNB" repository node here, because we just want to test uploading, but not actually publish our example data package.  
{:.notes}
  
```{r, handout = 0}
d1c <- D1Client("STAGING2", "urn:node:mnTestKNB") 
```
  
===  
  
Now do the actual uploading of your data package to the test repository location.  
  
```{r, handout = 0}
packageId <- uploadDataPackage(d1c, dp, public = TRUE, accessRules = dpAccessRules,
                               quiet = FALSE)
```
