## What is a data package?

A data package is a collection of data files and metadata files that describe the data.  

There are two equally important parts that make up a data package: _data_ and _metadata_.  
We will get into more details on these components in this lesson.  

===

## Why package and publish your data?  

1. Data is a valuable asset

2. Efficient collaboration

3. Credit for your work 

4. Funder requirement

5. Publisher requirement

6. Open, Reproducible Science

===

## Integrating data documentation 

It is important to incorporate documentation of your data throughout your reproducible research pipeline.

## Goals of data packaging

1. Improve sharing data with collaborators now.

2. Easily publish your data now or in the future.
