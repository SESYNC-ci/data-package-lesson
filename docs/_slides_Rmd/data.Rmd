## Data

Consistency is key when managing your data!

1. At a minimum, use the same terms to refer to the same things throughout your data.

2. Potentially use a discipline-wide published vocabulary (ex: [hydrological controlled vocab.]: http://vocabulary.odm2.org/)

### Naming data files - review from basic-R-lesson

Bad:
"CeNsus data*2ndTry 2/15/2017.csv"   

Good:
"census_data_try_2.csv"  # No dates: remember you're using git to version control!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

cen_dat <- read_csv("data/ACS/sector_ACS_15_5YR_S2413.csv")

```

### Formatting data - review from data-manipulation-R-lesson

1. One table/file for each type of observation.
2. Each variable has its own column.
3. Each observation has its own row.
4. Each value has its own cell.

Downstream operations/analysis require tidy data. You can work towards read-to-analyze data incrementally,
documenting the intermediate data and steps you took in your scripts.  This can be a powerful accelerator 
for your analysis both now and in the future.

Let's do a few checks to see if our data is tidy.
```{}
    - make sure data is long
    - make sure blanks are NA or some other standard
    - check date format
    - check case, white space, etc.  
```

### Outputting derived data - review from the basic-R-lesson
    
Because we followed the principle of one table/file for each type of observation, 
we have three tables to be written out to files now.  

```{}

```
