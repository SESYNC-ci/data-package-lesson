??? What dataset to use as an example dataset ???

## Data

naming data files
formatting data
outputting derived data

?? Do a few checks to make sure the data is tidy.
    - make sure data is long
    - make sure blanks are NA or some other standard
    - check date format
    - check case, white space, etc.  
    

    
Ideas from Openscapes: 
work towards ready-to-analyze data incrementally, documenting both the intermediate data and the process
â€œtidy data", which can be a powerful accelerator for analysis

One table for each type of observation.
1. Each variable has its own column.
2. Each observation has its own row.
3. Each value has its own cell.
Downstream operations require tidy data.

** Potentially connection to the joins stuff from the data manipulation lesson


consistency is key
using controlled vocab or standard way of describing things, even if only within your project
