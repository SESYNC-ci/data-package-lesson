## Data

Consistency is key when managing your data!

1. At a minimum, use the same terms to refer to the same things throughout your data.
2. Potentially use a discipline-wide published vocabulary (ex: hydrological vocab.)


```{}
# read in dataset here  ??? What dataset to use as an example dataset ???
```

### Naming data files - review from basic-R-lesson

```{}
"CeNsus data*2ndTry 2/15/2017.csv"   
"census_data_try_2.csv"  # No dates: remember you're using git to version control!
```

===

### Formatting data - review from data-manipulation-R-lesson

1. One table/file for each type of observation.
2. Each variable has its own column.
3. Each observation has its own row.
4. Each value has its own cell.

Downstream operations/analysis require tidy data. You can work towards read-to-analyze data incrementally,
documenting the intermediate data and steps you took in your scripts.  This can be a powerful accelerator 
for your analysis both now and in the future.

Let's do a few checks to see if our data is tidy.
```{}
    - make sure data is long
    - make sure blanks are NA or some other standard
    - check date format
    - check case, white space, etc.  
```

### Outputting derived data - review from the basic-R-lesson
    
Because we followed the principle of one table/file for each type of observation, 
we have three tables to be written out to files now.  

```{}

```
