## Publishing your data

Choosing to publish your data products in a long-term repository can:

   - fulfill a journal requirement to publish data
   - facilitate citing your dataset by assigning a permanent uniquely identifiable code (DOI)
   - improve discovery of and access to your dataset for others
   - enable re-use and greater visibility of your work

===

### Get an ORCiD 
 
ORCiDs identify you and link you to your publications and research products.  They are used by journals, repositories, etc. and often as a log in.  To obtain an ORCiD, register at [https://orcid.org]: https://orcid.org.

### Picking a repository 

There are many repositories out there, and it can seem overwhelming picking a suitable one for your data. 

Many repositories can be subject or domain specific.  [re3data]: https://www.re3data.org/ lists repositories by subject and can help you pick an appropriate repository for your data.  

For qualitative data, there are a few dedicated repositories: [QDR]: https://qdr.syr.edu/, [Data-PASS]: http://data-pass.org/


Mention Zenodo in the context of archiving their code from GitHub (emphasize not the data though).
