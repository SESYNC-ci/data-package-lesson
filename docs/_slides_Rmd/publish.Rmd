## Publishing your data

Choosing to publish your data products in a long-term repository can:

   - fulfill a journal requirement to publish data
   - facilitate citing your dataset by assigning a permanent uniquely identifiable code (DOI)
   - improve discovery of and access to your dataset for others
   - enable re-use and greater visibility of your work
