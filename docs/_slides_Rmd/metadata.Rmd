## What is Metadata?

Metadata is the information needed for someone else to understand and use your data.  

This include package-level _and_ file-level


## Metadata Standards

The goal is to have a machine and human readable description of your data. 

This can again mean using a controlled set of descriptors for your data specified by the standard. 

There are several metadata standards, and those standards can vary between disciplines
and types of data.  

Underlying one: XML

General ones: Dublin Core

Ecological/Environmental/Biological ones: EML, Darwin Core

Social science ones: DDI, EAD

Geospatial/Meterological/Oceanographic ones: ISO 19115, FGDC/CSDGM (no longer current)


## Common components of metadata

Package-level:
 - Geographic area of data (generally)
 - Data creator
 - Funding source

File-level:
 - Define variable names
 - Describe variables (units, etc.)
 - Define allowed values for a variable
 - Define units for variable


## Creating metadata

Employer-specific methods (ex: USGS)

Repository-specific methods

   GUI for a repository - show pretty picture here: 

   R packages (EML, dataspice)
