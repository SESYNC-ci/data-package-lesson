## Versioning Data

How do you know you're using the same version of a data file as your collaborator?
Do not edit raw data files!    Make edits/changes via your code only, and then output a derived "clean" data file. 

Potential ways forward for now: 
1. Upload successive versions of the data to a repo with versioning, but keep it private until you've reached the final version or the end of the project.  (see below)
2. Google Sheets has some support for viewing the edit history of cells, added or deleted columns and rows, changed formatting, etc.  


### Updating your data package on the repository

To take advantage of the versioning of data built into many repositories, you can update the data package (replace files with new versions).  

Please see the vignettes for [`rdataone`](https://github.com/DataONEorg/rdataone/blob/master/vignettes/upload-data.Rmd), section on "Replace an object with a newer version".

## Provenance

Prov is tracking the inputs and outputs generated by the research process, from raw data to publication(s).  
It is often very helpful to create a diagram that shows the relationships between files.  

A couple examples include: 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/simple_grv.PNG){: width="50%"} 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gfish_grv.PNG){: width="50%"}

### Adding provenance to your data package

Prov can be added to a data package using [`datapack`](https://github.com/ropensci/datapack/blob/master/vignettes/datapack-overview.Rmd)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dp <- describeWorkflow(dp, sources = doIn, program = progObj, derivations = doOut)
```

## Closing thoughts

Integrating data documentation and publication into your research workflow will increase your efficiency, reproducibility, and reach.
