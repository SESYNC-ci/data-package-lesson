## Caveats

Multiple excel files...how do you know you're using the same version of an excel file as your collaborator?
DON'T EDIT RAW DATA FILES!    Make edits in your code!!!!!

Potential ways forward for now: 
1. Upload data to a repo with versioning but keep it private while working on your project.
2. Google Sheets???

## And also...

Mention provenance, give examples, etc. at the end, but don't devote a lot of space to it at this point. 

Prov is tracking the inputs and outputs generated by the research process, from raw data to publication(s).
