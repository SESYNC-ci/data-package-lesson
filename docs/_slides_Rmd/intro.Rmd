## What is a data package?

A data package is a collection of data files and metadata files that describe the data and the project.  

There are two equally important parts that make up a data package: data and metadata.  
We will get into more details on these components in this lesson.  

===

## Why package and publish your data?  

1. Funder requirement

2. Publisher requirement

3. Efficient collaboration

4. Credit for your work

5. Open, Reproducible Science

## Integrating data documentation 

(Tie back into the workflow from the git lesson. Maybe make a figure here?? Flowchart?)

Raw data: may come with metadata if downloaded from somewhere; if you generate data, need to document it

Data cleaning/compilation/synthesis: Scipt any manipulation of the raw data (don't change the raw data file!)  Record all the steps used to process data.

Derived data: Output dervied data from script and document it

Outline steps along the data doc and pub process, and how they are integrated through research process.

## Goals of data packaging

1. Improve sharing data with collaborators now.

2. Easily publish your data in the future.
